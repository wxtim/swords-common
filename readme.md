It'd be nice to be acknowledged.

Some immoral usages, especially those involving gin,
are actively encouraged.

## To do List
* Add second style of swivel handle.
* Add standard 5 and 6 point locks with each sword style.
* Add a jpeg/png folder and consider whether it would be possible to auto-generate these.
* Look for sources for other lock styles.
* Consider adding longsword swords and locks.
